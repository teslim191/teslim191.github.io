[horse snorts]

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,291
Is the whole metaphor landing,
or is it too cerebral?

Aah! You stop... stop that,
or I... I'll, uh...

19
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,791
Or you'll what?

20

00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,750

00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,333

This woman just killed a man
with her bare hands

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,041
for trying to steal your horse.

38
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,375
Maybe she'll make
a better travel companion, then.

39
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,041
Uh, I'm sorry, who are you, exactly?

40
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,791
I am Borch Three Jackdaws.

00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,916
These are my companions,
Téa and Véa.

42
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,125
I've been looking for you,
Geralt of Rivia.

43
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,291
This is a first for me,
and that's saying something.

44
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,875
I've very few firsts left.

45
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,916

Your adventures are legend.

You're welcome.

Est Est, small.

49
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,416
I suppose you want me to tell you
why I've sought out

50
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,416
such an accomplished monster hunter.

51
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,559
- Don't trouble yourself on my account.
- [chuckling]

52
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,208
- [Geralt] I just want food.
- I knew I'd like you.

53
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,625
That was the first reason.

54
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,416
One of everything you have.
And keep the ale coming!

55
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,666
[innkeeper] On its way!

56
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,041
The second one is this.

57
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:36,875
A short while ago,

58
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:41,625
a green dragon landed across the border
in King Niedamir's mountains.

59
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,541
I know what you're thinking.

60
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,166
"Impossible, dragons are so rare."

61
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,875
But it's true.

62
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,708
Locals spotted it
and went after it in search of treasure.

63
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,791
Of course, they succeeded only
in wounding the creature

64
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,708
and angering it so righteously

65
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,958
that it swooped down from its lair
and set half a hillside ablaze.

66
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,375
- Hm.
- [Borch] Dead sheep everywhere.

67
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,151
You have the most incredible neck.

68
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,875
- [sighs]
- It's like a... a sexy goose.

69
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,291
Ugh.

70
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,166
Gu... guzzling.

71
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,125
[Borch] Now, the King is in a bind.

72
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:19,291
He's set to marry the princess
of his rival kingdom, Malleore,

73
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,750
which means it's bad timing

74
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,583
to have a murderous pest lurking about
in the mountains.

75
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,750
He's commissioned a hunt to kill it.

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,208
Four teams have signed on.

77
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,750
The winner gets the dragon treasure hoard

78
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:35,375
plus the title of lord
over one of his new vassal states.

79
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,333
That is... if he survives.

80
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,458
What does this have to do with me?

81
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,291
I want you to join my team.

82
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,291
[Jaskier] I can hear it now,

83
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,458
a tale of two Zerrikanians

84
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,333
and their valiant poet lover.

85
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,291
Oh! [chuckles]
We're so doing this. We're in.

86
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,208
You've wasted your breath, Borch.

87
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,583
I don't kill dragons.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,916
[sighs]

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,208
[Geralt] Take my advice.

90
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,083
No treasure is worth dying for.

91
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,291
Depends on the treasure.

92
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,958
What I need is...

93
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,083
a new adventure.

94
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,666
One final first before I'm too old
to do anything but die.

95
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,500
You think killing a dragon
will bring you that?

96
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,000
All I know is there's one path
up the mountain,

97
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,250
and it's overrun with monsters.

98
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,833
With you on my team, dear Witcher,
we'll be unstoppable.

99
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,000
- [men laughing]
- [man] Someone get me a fuckin' drink!

100
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,958
- Barman!
- Those dwarfs will be part of the hunt.

101
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,708
Barman.

102
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,541
- Geralt could handle them in his sleep.
- Fuckin' right!

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,041
He said he wants four fuckin' pints!

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,375
- Now.
- Or maybe a little bit awake.

105
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,458
[Téa] Then there are the Reavers.

106
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,541
Have you heard of them, Witcher?

107
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,625
Yes.

108
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,083
And the answer is no.

109
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,041
You feel it just the same as me...

110
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,250
that hole inside you.

111
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,916
That itch that can't be scratched
that burns your brain,

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
keeps you awake at night.

113
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,125
Come with me.

114
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,583
I'll show you what you're missing.

115
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,333
What am I missing?

116
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,458
Sorry to interrupt this lovely moment...
That's only three.

117
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,708
Where's the... What's the fourth team?

118
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,416
- [Geralt] Hm.
- Them.

119
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,875
Oh! [laughs]

120
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,208
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Oh, no, no, no.

121
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,771
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Thank you so much. It's been very nice.

122
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,833
Thank you for the wine and the pies,

123
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,876
but as the man said,
we really can't get involved.

124
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,000
Geralt, shall we?

125
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,000
- I'm in.
- Mother of...

126
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,083
The hunt begins at sunrise.

127
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,083
[sighs]

128
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,208
Your man might've mentioned
that the road was too narrow for horses

129
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,791
in his initial sales pitch.

130
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,041
Welcome to the world, Jaskier.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,083
Damn it to Korath!

132
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:33,916
What's got your goat?

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,458
Someone's stolen my pack.

134
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,541
Probably those fuckin' Reavers!

135
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,375
Aye, well...

136
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,375
three days' journey
and only one route to the top.

137
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,291
Leaves plenty of time
for me to piss in his gruel! [cackles]

138
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:52,958
Aah.

139
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,291
Name's Yarpen Zigrin.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,166
Geralt of Rivia.

141
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,458
- And my name is Julian Alfred Pankratz...
- Aye. I know.

142
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,708
You'll fetch a goodly amount for that mare
if you sell now!

143
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,541
Charming how everyone wants to get
their hands on Roach these days, isn't it?

144
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,416
He means we won't make it out alive.

145
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,791
Wait, what? No one mentioned anything
about impending death!

146
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,083
How is it
that I've walked this earth for decades

147
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,791
without coming across a witcher,

148
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,791
and then the first one I meet,
I can't get rid of?

149
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,675
[Jaskier] I'd say
something strange was afoot,

150
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,875
but then again, witchers are bound
to bump into monsters eventually.

151
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,625
[laughs]

152
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,458
- Jaskier.
- [Jaskier] Yennefer.

153
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,208
The crow's feet are new.

154
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,875
Yeah, well, your jokes are...

155
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,708
old.

156
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,083
[scoffs]

157
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,625
[nickers]

158
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,708
Thanks, Roach.

159
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,541
- What are you doing here, Yen?
- [Yennefer] I'm here with my escort.

160
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,541
Noble Sir Eyck of Denesle.

161
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,375
To assist him in killing the dragon.

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,166
For kingdom and glory!

163
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,750
Till we meet again, Geralt.

164
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,166
See you, Roach.

165
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,375
[bugle blowing]

166
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,500
[bugle blowing continues]

167
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,750
[Ciri] Who is Geralt, exactly?

168
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,416
Did my grandmother know him well?

169
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,250
Why did she never mention him
to me before... that night?

170
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,833
Protecting you has always been
our primary purpose.

171
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,125
Why'd she let him claim
the Law of Surprise?

172
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,208
What's that even mean?

173
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,708
When one has saved another
from certain death,

174
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,416
the Law of Surprise can be claimed

175
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,000
to pay that debt.

176
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,621
[Ciri] Who did Geralt save?

177
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,333
[sighs] Your father.

178
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,583
Duny. In payment, he bound you to Geralt.

179
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,208
- It's your destiny.
- [scoffs]

180
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,916
Then why hasn't he found me yet?

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,458
Questions, questions.

182
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,000
You'll be together soon.

183
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,708
Exactly as your grandmother wished.

184
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,208
Make haste, children.

185
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,375
[Jaskier] It is so kind of you
to share the spoils of this expedition

186
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,958
with an old man such as Borch.

187
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,708
You're like two fiercely loyal...

188
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,666
uh, friends.

189
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,458
I wanna say friends. Relatives.

190
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,333
Contract security.

191
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,750
To hunt with him is an honor
unsullied by payment.

192
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,333
But why? [chuckles]

193
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,916
He is the most beautiful.

194
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,541
[sighs]

195
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,125
You worry if you blink,
you'll never see her again.

196
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,916
You're in love with her.

197
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,750
Or...

198
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,416
the danger here isn't the dragon.

199
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,708
[Borch] That's why I brought you along,
Geralt of Rivia.

200
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,208
Nothing scares you.

201
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,291
[Geralt] Huh.

202
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,666
Then you don't know
Yennefer of Vengerberg.

203
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,000
[Borch laughs]

204
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,500
May she be the worst encounter, then.

205
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,625
[Jaskier] Melitele preserve us.

206
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,041
What happened here?

207
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,041
[Geralt] Dragons avoid people.

208
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,166
It should have left when they attacked.

209
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,083
I don't get it. Why the retaliation?

210
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,041
When your species is
on the verge of collapse,

211
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,958
perhaps everything becomes more desperate.

212
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,708
[Jaskier] Yeah, I mean, you can use twigs,

213
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,125
uh, but I... I mean, I personally prefer...

214
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,791
using flowers, you know?

215
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,208
Roses.

216
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,375
Daffodils.

217
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,625
- [hissing]
- Flora and, yikes, fauna.

218
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,083
A cactus, if she's really into it.

219
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,333
Ladies, you look famished.

220
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,291
Allow me to wander aimlessly
into this thicket

221
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,000
and retrieve for you, uh...

222
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,625
a tasty afternoon treat.

223
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,708
Uh... uh...

224
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,333
Right. Hm.

225
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,500
- I am hungry. Anyone else hungry?
- [sighs]

226
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,875
I could genuinely eat a...

227
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,166
Okay.

228
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,833
- [grunts]
- [animal barks]

229
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,666
[whimpering]

230
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,000
There's something back here.

231
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,166
It sort of looks like a faun.

232
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,833
- Jaskier...
- [Jaskier] Hello.

233
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,000
- Hello, little fellow.
- [animal whimpering]

234
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,416
Aw! Aren't you just the cutest...

235
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,041
[animal growls]

236
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,750
[stammers] Most...

237
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,916
terrifying thing I've ever seen
in my entire life.

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,458
Right, run away! Run away! Geralt!

239
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,125
[animal growling]

240
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,583
It's one of your... friends again.

241
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,916
[exclaims]

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
[low growl]

243
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,125
- What in the name of Bloemenmagde is that?
- [Geralt] It's an hirikka.

244
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,583
It's probably starving.
Sheathe your weapons.

245
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,875
- [grunts]
- [roars]

246
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,208
[whimpers]

247
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,166
- [yells]
- [hirikka cries]

248
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,250
- [Eyck grunting]
- [slashing and thumping]

249
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,916
[yelling]

250
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,625
[continues yelling]

251
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,583
[panting]

252
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,416
- For kingdom and glory!
- Sir Eyck!

253
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,500
[sighs] Yeah...

254
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,000
You could have been killed!

255
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,416
If we'd fed it, it would've gone away.

256
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Thanks.

257
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,708
That knight may be a fuckin' dumbbell,

258
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,500
but I'll be damned,
the dragon won't stand a chance.

259
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,583
[Borch] Um...
I'm not sure I'd eat that, good sir.

260
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,666
[scoffs]

261
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,625
Knights never waste a kill.

262
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,833
[coughs]

263
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,000
It's precisely why I'll make a great lord
to Niedamir's vassal state.

264
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,166
A great knight must lead by example.

265
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,416
- For...
- Kingdom and glory.

266
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,083
We know.

267
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,333
My subjects will be the luckiest serfs
in all the lands.

268
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,666
Especially with the beautiful Yennefer
as my mage.

269
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,041
I cannot wait to serve you, My Lord.

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,166
How would you like to serve me tonight...

271
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,083
- Witch?
- Careful, Boholt.

272
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,208
[grunts]

273
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:38,666
[chuckles]

274
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,750
So, the Witcher wants
to play knight too, hmm?

275
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,958
No.

276
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,375
She's plenty able
of murdering you herself.

277
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,708
[Boholt laughs]

278
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,666
What's so amusin',
you overgrown cock hair?

279
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,083
I'm just wondering who I will kill first.

280
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,500
The monster,

281
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,916
or the monster hunter.

282
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,541
Hm.

283
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,458
[Eyck's stomach gurgles]

284
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,416
[sighs]

285
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,875
Oh, dear.

286
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,666
Um... I'm afraid I must take my leave.

287
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,916
Lady Yennefer,
may I escort you to your tent?

288
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,375
Will you be joining me?

289
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,458
- Uh... My Lady, I would...
- [stomach gurgling]

290
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,250
...never degrade your honor
in such a way.

291
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,500
[snorts] I hate to break it to you,
but that ship has sailed,

292
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,541
wrecked and sunk to the bottom
of the ocean.

293
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,458
Ow.

294
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,291
- [farting]
- Oh...

295
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,333
[straining] I need a shit.

296
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,750
[laughs]

297
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,833
[Eyck whimpers]

298
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,541
[Yarpen] So, shall we tell
the poor bastard

299
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,791
that he's vying for a vassal state
that won't exist in a decade?

300
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,208
States rise and fall like the tide.

301
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,083
Nothing new.

302
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,333
This is fuckin' new!

303
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,761
The rightful son of Nilfgaard
has returned, burnin' through the south.

304
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,416
With Fringilla as his mage.

305
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,916
[laughs] Nilfgaard's a joke.

306
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,875
I saw it with my own eyes
down in Ebbing.

307
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,541
Those zealot freaks are inching closer
by the day.

308
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,000
Won't be long till they try
and take Sodden.

309
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,500
Next it'll be Temeria.

310
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,125
Redania.

311
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,833
- Cintra.
- No.

312
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,565
Queen Calanthe would die
before letting them take what's hers.

313
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,916
Perhaps if Nilfgaard's religious zeal
had been tempered earlier

314
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,833
by a stronger hand...

315
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,250
If you'll excuse me,

316
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,916
I must get my beauty sleep.

317
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,291
I don't think it'll make me prettier,

318
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,000
but I need sleep too.

319
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,291
So... we're all about to have
new evil overlords,

320
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,833
and dragons are, in fact, a thing.

321
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,125
- Good day all round.
- [laughing]

322
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,916
Oh, you've all seen
a dragon before, have you?

323
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,360
Geralt, will you please tell them?

324
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,916
Their numbers are dwindling.

325
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,708
Treasure seekers saw to that.
But they do exist.

326
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,375
What people call "green dragons,"

327
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,250
like the one we have here,

328
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,333
they're the most common.

329
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,125
Red dragons, less so.

330
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,833
Black dragons are the rarest.

331
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,208
Gold dragons are rarest.

332
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,250
Gold dragons are a myth.

333
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,291
For a gold dragon to exist,

334
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,583
it would... have to be the result of...

335
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,791
an accidental, unique mutation.

336
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,166
And in <i>my</i> experience,

337
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,333
mutations, they're intentional.

338
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,250
But it doesn't matter.

339
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,375
Mutant or myth,

340
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:49,125
gold dragons met the same fate
as anything too different to endure.

341
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,333
They died out.

342
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,333
There are other ways of enduring.

343
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,958
If it's legacy you're after,

344
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,833
perhaps you should take the overgrown
cock hair's advice and become a knight.

345
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,208
[laughing]

346
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,458
Sir Witcher...

347
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,250
the White-Haired...

348
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,833
of Rivia.

349
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,458
[chuckling]

350
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,541
You'd make a rather shitty one,
refusing to slay dragons.

351
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,250
[laughing]

352
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:21,166
But probably not as shitty a one
as Sir Eyck of Denesle!

353
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,375
[laughing]

354
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,291
[Mousesack] Keep walking.
The Nilfgaardians could be anywhere.

355
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,541
We're not safe yet.

356
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,833
[Dara] How did you escape the attack,
Mousesack?

357
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,041
[Ciri] Dara, please.

358
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,375
[Dara]
Ciri says you vanished into thin air.

359
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,500
Why did you abandon your Princess?

360
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,083
We were...

361
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,125
I was pulled through a portal
by Nilfgaard,

362
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,916
kidnapped and held prisoner for days.

363
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,875
And how did you escape them?

364
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,791
Geralt.

365
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,000
He sent me to get Ciri.

366
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,041
The Witcher?

367
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,875
Trained to fight and bound to Ciri.

368
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,333
And he rescued you
so you could then rescue her?

369
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,250
- Alone?
- Ask him yourself.

370
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,666
He's in a town

371
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,333
just past this thicket of trees.

372
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,083
We must find him.

373
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,041
To safety.

374
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,875
[quietly]
Something's off about this, Ciri.

375
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,083
- The waters there were...
- Yes, they've worn off,

376
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,875
which means I'm thinking straight.

377
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,291
Do you know what happens to people
who escape a siege?

378
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,000
Because they don't just vanish.

379
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,166
They get captured and they get turned.

380
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,041
Remember what the Dryad Queen said.

381
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,463
- "Ask the right questions."
- [Mousesack sighs]

382
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,833
It's not just your life, Ciri.
It's mine too.

383
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,500
[clinking]

384
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,125
[Mousesack] Princess, I forgot.

385
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,125
I brought this for you.

386
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,333
My grandmother's sash.

387
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,708
[gasps]

388
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,750
[birds chirping]

389
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,291
Has anyone seen my escort?

390
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,666
[Yarpen] Ah! Bloody ball sacks!

391
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,375
Who slits a man's throat
while he's relieving his bowels?

392
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,041
Is nothing sacred anymore?

393
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,958
Ugh.

394
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,791
Fuck!

395
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,208
[Véa] We're halfway to the dragon's lair,
but it's getting dangerous.

396
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:56,041
- We cannot continue like this.
- [Yarpen] The warrior woman is right.

397
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,291
Someone killed that self-righteous fud,

398
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,708
and it wasn't any of us.

399
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,916
Somebody's not playin' fair.

400
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,166
Our people used to mine these mountains.

401
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,166
We know a shortcut
that will cut half a day off our journey.

402
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,333
Let the Reavers take the long way around.

403
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,333
We'll nab the treasure
before they even set foot in the cave.

404
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,875
We'll watch each other's backs
until we reach the next peak,

405
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,625
then every man for himself.

406
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,375
- What say ye?
- Let's go.

407
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,666
Aah!

408
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,666
Go on. I'll catch up.

409
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,458
Did you kill Eyck?

410
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,083
Kill him?

411
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,625
That's rather pedestrian.

412
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,208
And you're the one who's been
staring daggers at him since we arrived.

413
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,291
It was the Reavers.

414
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,958
That bastard Boholt killed my escort

415
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,541
before he could accomplish the one
damn task I actually needed him for.

416
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,625
And what was that?

417
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,875
Yen!

418
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,500
What are you really doing here?

419
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm here for the dragon.

420
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,833
There are certain healing properties
it's rumored to possess.

421
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,583
I thought your transformation

422
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,250
healed all parts of you?

423
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,125
At the cost of losing others, yes.

424
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,458
Yennefer...

425
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,041
do not tell me
you've traveled all this way

426
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,541
for made-up fertility cures
using fresh dragon hearts?

427
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,208
- They're not made up!
- They are.

428
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,875
And seriously?

429
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,958
You, a mother?

430
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,500
Do you think I'd make a bad one?

431
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,416
Definitely.

432
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:44,625
Yen...

433
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,666
A child? What could you possibly want
with a child?

434
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,333
They took my choice. I want it back.

435
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,125
Not that I'd expect you to understand.

436
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,708
I didn't choose to become a witcher.

437
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,000
[sighs] Listen...

438
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,208
the people who made us,

439
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,166
they made us sterile for a lot of reasons.

440
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,541
One of the kinder ones

441
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,916
is because this lifestyle isn't suited
to a child.

442
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,250
What?

443
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:23,041
You were going to summon chaos
on kings' orders

444
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,333
in between feeding and naps?

445
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,916
- Do not patronize me!
- I'm not.

446
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
I've thought about this. Often.

447
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,375
And I'd rather use
my Child Surprise as bruxa bait

448
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,416
than subject it to this life!

449
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,875
What did you just say?

450
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,708
Uh...

451
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,708
Ah, fuck!

452
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,625
You have a Child Surprise?

453
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,541
[laughs]

454
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,125
Isn't that rich?

455
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,958
You lecture me on made-up cures
for having a child,

456
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,958
meanwhile you cheat with destiny
to steal one.

457
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,083
Every time I'm near you,

458
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,416
I say more in five minutes
than I've said in weeks.

459
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,000
And I always regret it.

460
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,666
[sighs]

461
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,041
The dwarfs,

462
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,458
they're leading us to a shorter path.

463
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,583
Come along.

464
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,000
I can take care of myself.

465
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,666
You don't always have to.

466
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,166
Come with me.

467
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,833
He's waiting for us.

468
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,166
Did you ever stop missing Skellige?

469
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,625
What?

470
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:57,791
It's just that I don't think
I'll ever stop missing Cintra, but...

471
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:02,000
you left your home to come raise me,
how did you feel about that?

472
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:04,375
I was...

473
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:07,125
very homesick.

474
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,250
Remember when we'd visit?

475
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,541
Ice skating with Crach an Craite?

476
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,416
He always said he let me win,
but I was just faster.

477
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:22,166
- Did you miss the cold too?
- Yes, very much.

478
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,041
- Except you have arthritis!
- [sighs]

479
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,708
You hate the cold!

480
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,875
And you always said Skellige
was where you came from

481
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:32,083
but Cintra was your home, with us!

482
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:34,000
- Hey!
- I've had enough of you.

483
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:37,458
- Mousesack, stop!
- Our name is not Mousesack!

484
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,875
We killed Mousesack

485
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,750
- and took his disgusting form...
- [gasps]

486
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,000
- ...to find you.
- [yells]

487
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,583
[groans]

488
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:51,291
- [sizzling]
- [Doppler yells]

489
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,250
[grunting]

490
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:59,958
We prefer it like this anyway.

491
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,583
[yells]

492
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:08,875
[groaning]

493
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,958
[rumbling]

494
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,708
[grunting]

495
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,416
[snarls]

496
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,958
[yelling]

497
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,291
Where are you taking us?
Who wants her?

498
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,500
- The man with the winged helmet.
- Why is he going to so much trouble?

499
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:32,083
I'm special. I don't know how or why,
but there's something inside me.

500
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,125
- Kill him!
- What?

501
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,375
Then I'll do it!

502
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:37,750
Wait, no, no, no, no, no!

503
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:41,208
[snarling]

504
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,291
[yells]

505
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,166
[Yarpen]
Mind the scree fallin', hear me?

506
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,541
Can get a bit rocky round here
if it's windy.

507
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,250
Which...

508
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
it is.

509
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,208
[wind whistling]

510
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
We're here.

511
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:16,666
Yeah, you're right, this is a shortcut...
to death.

512
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,583
You wanna beat those Reavers or not?

513
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,833
- We should turn back.
- No.

514
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,976
- We're very close.
- How can you possibly know that?

515
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,250
'Tis a perfectly fine route.

516
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,500
- For a dwarf.
- Aah!

517
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,750
Stifle your mewlin'. You'll manage.

518
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,375
As long as you don't look down.

519
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,416
- [groans]
- [laughs]

520
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
[sighs]

521
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,833
- [Yarpen] See ya on the other side!
- [Jaskier] Yeah, yeah, yes.

522
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,666
- Uh...
- [Yarpen shouts]

523
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,208
Uh, ladies first?

524
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,000
Ah! All right. Yep.

525
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,958
Come on, Jask. You've got this.

526
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,458
- You've got this.
- [Yarpen] Come on!

527
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,458
[Yennefer grunts]

528
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,375
[Yarpen] Careful!

529
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:01,916
Oh, whoa!

530
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,708
Oh, fuck! Oh...

531
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,166
Oh, that is not a good sign.

532
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,958
That is not a good sign.

533
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,625
[Yarpen shouts]

534
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,083
[wood creaking]

535
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,625
[Jaskier] Phew!

536
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:54,708
[creaking]

537
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:57,458
- [Véa screams]
- [Borch groans]

538
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,875
- [yells]
- [Geralt] Okay...

539
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,291
- [gasps]
- [strains]

540
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,333
- Geralt!
- Get back!

541
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,750
Sir Witcher, you will save us yet.

542
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:14,375
But first, you must let go.

543
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:15,958
No.

544
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,375
[creaking]

545
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:19,625
- [grunts]
- [Yennefer gasps]

546
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,333
- Geralt! The planks won't hold!
- [panting]

547
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,083
Thank you.

548
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,291
[grunts] No!

549
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,708
[gasps]

550
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,666
[Jaskier] You did your best.

551
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,208
There's nothing else you could have done.

552
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,208
[wind whistling]

553
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,875
Look, why don't we leave tomorrow?

554
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,625
That is, if you'll give me another chance
to prove myself a...

555
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,250
worthy travel companion.

556
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:49,916
[Geralt] Hm.

557
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,875
We could head to the coast.

558
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,125
Get away for a while.

559
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,458
Sounds like something Borch would say,
doesn't it?

560
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:04,583
Life is too short.

561
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,375
Do what pleases you...

562
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,166
while you can.

563
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,875
[Geralt] Composing your next song?

564
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,583
[Jaskier] No, I'm just, uh...

565
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,291
Just trying to work out what pleases me.

566
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:41,208
[sighs]

567
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,083
Hm.

568
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,291
So simple.

569
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,416
- Do you like it?
- [sighs]

570
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,583
[sighs]

571
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,708
Is this not what you came for?

572
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:16,500
I came for you.

573
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,291
I was afraid
that mountain would take you from me,

574
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,916
but now I fear
it took your senses instead.

575
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,833
Only my nonsense.

576
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,416
I quite like your nonsense.

577
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,583
[sighing] Hm...

578
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,625
That scent.

579
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:48,000
<i>The moment I dread most
every time you leave...</i>

580
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:51,833
<i>is when it fades.</i>

581
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,875
[sighs]

582
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:58,750
When you're really gone.

583
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,583
You left first.

584
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:04,791
In Rinde.

585
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,375
<i>I woke up in that destroyed house
and you were gone.</i>

586
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,375
Forgive me.

587
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,208
Do you hurt?

588
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,500
I don't mean physical pain.

589
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:15,333
They say
witchers can't feel human emotion.

590
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:21,250
They say whatever justifies
despising our kind.

591
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:22,708
Huh.

592
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,041
Do you regret it?

593
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,083
Becoming a witcher?

594
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,541
[sighs]

595
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:33,166
It's hard to regret something
you didn't choose.

596
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:35,875
But if the choice had been yours,

597
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:39,375
what would you have done instead?

598
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,250
A farmer?

599
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:45,958
A stableman?

600
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,541
[both chuckle]

601
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,458
- Horses are good company.
- [laughs]

602
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:54,500
But if I ever dreamed
of being something...

603
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,666
other... than what I am...

604
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,125
it was too long ago to remember.

605
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,750
Did you dream of being a mage?

606
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,250
I didn't have much of a choice either.

607
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,583
[sighs]

608
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,416
Did you always want to become a mother?

609
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,291
I dreamed...

610
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,375
of becoming important to someone.

611
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:33,833
Someday.

612
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Hm.

613
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:39,416
Do I bore you?

614
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:43,125
[chuckles] Not at all.

615
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,083
[laughs]

616
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,208
Before we met,

617
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:49,250
the days were calm...

618
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,250
and the nights were restless.

619
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:56,500
But now... [sighs]

620
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,541
you're important to me.

621
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:24,166
Good morning.

622
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,833
Hm.

623
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,166
- [bird calling]
- [wind whistling]

624
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,916
At a quick pace, we can make it back
to the Pensive Dragon before sundown.

625
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,916
What are you talking about?
We're almost at the top.

626
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:49,166
I came here for a reason, Geralt.

627
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,708
I'm not leaving
till I've killed that dragon.

628
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,458
Yen, no!

629
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,541
- What will it solve?
- It will solve everything.

630
00:37:58,833 --> 00:37:59,833
Wait.

631
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,875
Where are those fucking dwarfs?

632
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,416
Yen!

633
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,541
[yelps]

634
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,958
[whimpers]

635
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:30,458
[breathing shakily]

636
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,041
Don't scream.

637
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,000
I understand why you're afraid.

638
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,958
If there had been any other way
to extract you, I'd have done it.

639
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:54,458
It was never my intention
to torment you, Princess.

640
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
All I want...

641
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:02,000
all I've ever wanted is
to help you fulfill your destiny.

642
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,416
The White Flame has brought us together.

643
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,625
You are the key to everything, Cirilla.

644
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:18,958
You must be starving.

645
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,125
I'll get you something to eat.

646
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:35,916
[crackling]

647
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,083
[rumbling]

648
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,125
What have you done?

649
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:56,500
You lied to us.

650
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,083
You didn't tell us what she is.

651
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,625
What she's capable of.

652
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,375
You fucking fool!

653
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:08,916
[grunting]

654
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:17,750
[panting] Uh-uh!

655
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,208
We know all your tricks.

656
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:20,958
[yells]

657
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:25,125
[yells]

658
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,083
Do you really believe all this nonsense
in your head?

659
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:41,791
- This prophecy?
- [groans]

660
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,250
We think you're insane!

661
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:44,458
[yells]

662
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,958

- [crunching]
- You are an abomination!

666
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,875
I will destroy you!

667
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,500
[both grunting]

668
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,291

[grunting]

671
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:25,166
You're still here, aren't you?

672
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:37,250
[scree tumbling]

[shuddering]

[gasps]

677
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:40,583
No closer!

678
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:43,875
What the fuck?

679
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,125
Get back!

680
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:49,041
You should've stayed dead.

681
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:51,375
[Geralt] Stop!

682
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:57,625
How?

683
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:02,791
He's dead.

684
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,458
<i>She's </i>dead.

685
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:08,083
[roaring]

686
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,166
[roars]

687
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,250
[Borch] Sir Witcher and his sorceress.

688
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:34,666
[low growl]

689
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,958
Hello again.

690
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:43,791
Impossible.

691
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:46,375
[Téa] When the dragoness was injured,

692
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,083
her cry was heard by Villentretenmerth.

693
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:51,208
But the egg could not be moved

694
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,583
or the life inside it would die.

695
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:55,541
That's why the dragon attacked.

696
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,458
[heart beating]

697
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,250
She was protecting her baby.

698
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,916
[Téa] And then we heard
about the King's hunt,

699
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,708
realized we had to keep our enemies close.

700
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:08,916
So I came to find you,

701
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,041
the white-haired witcher,

702
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:15,208
the knight who was taught
to save dragons instead of kill them.

703
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,291
[growling]

704
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:22,666
Looks like
we get to fuck up the whole family.

705
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,333
Slay that dragon!

706
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:25,750
[Geralt yells]

707
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,250
Kill them!

708
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,416
Boholt's mine!

709
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,875
<i>Aard, </i>now!

710
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:57,458
[yelling]

711
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,208
[low growl]

712
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,000
[Borch] I'm afraid we have more.

713
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,500
Go! I'll protect the egg.

714
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:19,583
Get them!

715
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,041
- [Yennefer yells]
- [grunts]

716
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:07,958
[Yennefer yells]

717
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,875
So I get to kill you after all, Witcher.

718
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:22,041
[yells]

719
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,250
[roaring]

720
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,541
It's not going to happen!

721
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:54,416
Shame you don't get to see me
crack that egg!

722
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:56,708
[groans]

723
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:08,458
[both panting]

724
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:15,000
[gasps]

725
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,458
Uh...

726
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:21,583
[sniffs]

727
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,458
Geralt?

728
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:41,416
Dwarfs?

729
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,791
Oh, gosh. Phew!

730
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:46,916
Ah! What'd I miss?

731
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:48,583
Huh?

732
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:50,458
- Guys?
- [groaning]

733
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:52,791
Are we... queuing for something?

734
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:54,291
- What's going on?
- [gasping]

735
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:55,833
Oh, no!

736
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:03,708
Oh, fuck!

737
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:06,500
What happened?

738
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,458
Oh, gosh!

739
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:10,958
Oh! Bloody hell.

740
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:13,458
What the fuck are you doing here?

741
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:24,208
Well, that's fuckin' shite!
We missed a whole mother lode of fun.

742
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:35,583
Ask no questions, and in return,
I offer you these to take to the King.

743
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:39,291
Dragon teeth?

744
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,750
I've never been one
to look a gift cock in the beak,

745
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:45,193
though this might not be enough proof
to collect the reward.

746
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:48,750
Tell the King if he's not satisfied,

747
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:52,708
he can expect the body of a dragon
dropped upon his royal wedding.

748
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,166
Free of charge.

749
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,875
[laughing]

750
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:08,208
Aah!

751
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:17,541
[whimpering]

752
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,875
[twigs snapping]

753
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:29,000
[footsteps approaching]

754
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:32,125
[whimpers]

755
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:40,833
[muffled cries]

756
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,583
He caught me. He's going to come back,
Dara. We have to hurry.

757
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:49,750
[Dara curses in Elder]

758
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:52,353
If we had just stayed in Brokilon, Ciri,
we'd be safe right now!

759
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:55,291
- How could I have known?
- Because we agreed to it. Hmm?

760
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:59,208
If I stay with you any longer,
I'll be dead too.

761
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,625
And you say you're so special.

762
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,916
What you really mean is
that you're just like Calanthe!

763
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:07,708
You bring terror and you bring death
wherever you are!

764
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,875
I'm doing the best that I can.

765
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,750
I'm done apologizing.
I'm done with all of this.

766
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,208
I have to move on.

767
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:25,958
You're right, Princess.

768
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:30,166
Find a new family,

769
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:32,750
because I can't be there for you anymore.

770
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:57,916
This is my final first.

771
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:01,125
A child.

772
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:04,625
This treasure, this legacy

773
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:06,208
must endure.

774
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:09,291
There is no other reason to go on.

775
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:12,291
Thank you for protecting it.

776
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,875
And thank you, Yennefer of Vengerberg.

777
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:19,708
I can see why Geralt didn't want
to lose you.

778
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:22,541
What does that mean?

779
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,000
In Rinde.

780
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:36,625
The djinn.

781
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:41,083
That's why we can't escape each other.

782
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,833
Why I feel this way inside.

783
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,333
No.

784
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:48,291
[Yennefer]
It's not because of anything real...

785
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:49,916
or true.

786
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:53,416
You made a wish.

787
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It's magic.

788
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,791
- It's real, Yen.
- How could we ever know?

789
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:05,375
Disregard for other's freedom
has become quite your trademark.

790
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:08,958
- I made that wish to save your life.
- I didn't need your help!

791
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:10,166
Like fuck you didn't!

792
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:13,958
And you, you flit about like a tornado,

793
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:16,666
wreaking havoc, and for what?

794
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:18,750
So you can have a baby?

795
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:22,750
A child is no way
to boost your fragile ego, Yen.

796
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:26,125
I'll take advice from you about children
as soon as you take responsibility

797
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:28,088
for the one you bound to you
and then abandoned!

798
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,333
[Borch] That's enough.

799
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:37,666
I'm going to save you both a lot of hurt
with a little pain now.

800
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:42,083
The sorceress will never regain her womb.

801
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,375
And though you didn't want to lose her,
Geralt,

802
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:48,750
you will.

803
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:54,666
He already has.

804
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,791
You wanted to show me
what I was missing...

805
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:17,333
there she goes.

806
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:21,958
What you're missing is still out there.

807
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:23,958
Your legacy.

808
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:26,875
Your destiny. I know it.

809
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,416
And you know it.

810
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:46,416
[Jaskier] Phew! What a day! [chuckles]

811
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:49,541
- I imagine you're probably...
- Damn it, Jaskier!

812
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:53,083
Why is it whenever I find myself
in a pile of shit these days,

813
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:55,458
- it's you, shoveling it?
- Well, that's not fair.

814
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:57,791
The Child Surprise, the djinn,

815
00:53:57,875 --> 00:53:58,875
all of it!

816
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:01,500
If life could give me one blessing,

817
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:04,333
it would be to take you off my hands.

818
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,333
Right. Uh...

819
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:18,833
Right, then.

820
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:21,875
I'll...

821
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,416
I'll go get the rest of the story
from the others.

822
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:30,583
See you around, Geralt.

823
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:00,000
[Cahir winces]

824
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:02,208
[Fringilla]
They're combing the area.

825
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:04,750
They haven't found him,

826
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:06,541
or the girl.

827
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:14,833
A simple test of silver would've sufficed.

828
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,041
I had steel at the ready.

829
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:21,250
We can pull in more soldiers.
Keep searching.

830
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:23,458
We won't stop.

831
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
We cannot mistake the stars reflecting
in a pond for those in the night sky.

832
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:31,916
Spare me the lecture, Fringilla.

833
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:44,666
You rose up against the Usurper.

834
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:49,791
Helped free our people from their chains.

835
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:54,333
I witnessed the White Flame call on you...

836
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:58,208
mold you...

837
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:01,541
anoint <i>you.</i>

838
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:05,875
It burns in you, Cahir.

839
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:09,625
She is the key,

840
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:11,958
but you...

841
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:14,625
you are the commissioner.

842
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:18,375
Do not despair.

843
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,250
We will find her.

844
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:23,416
And we will spread his supremacy
all through the kingdoms,

845
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,875
whether they deserve it...

846
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:26,750
or not.

847
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:31,833
Gather the men.

848
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:36,875
We cannot fail him.

849
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:50,666
